# Biomechancial Testing
This was apart of the Biomedical Engineering Lab 1 where we had to obtain stress-strain relations for thre point bending tests conducted on various specimen.

The final data analysis and visualization is on the jupyter notebook included in the repository. All calculations and algorithms have been laid our in the StressStrain.py file
